Install PIP packages. It's important to download yt-dlp from github directly because Youtube regularly implements changes to stop ytdlp from downloading, so they must regularly update to fix this.
	pip install -U git+https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp.git
	pip install spotipy
	pip install music_tag

Install FFMPEG
	sudo apt install ffmpeg
